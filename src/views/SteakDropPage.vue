      The Steakdrop Party will be on 16th of July in 2022.<br>
      If you are eligible you have been contacted already, if not, please contact us.<br>
      <br>
      We will provide drinks and food, you don't have to bring any. <br>
      But it would be nice if you can bring your <b>own dishes</b>. We don't have enough and no dishwasher.<br>
      <br>
      The party will take place at a swimming pond close to a forest in Odenwald. Please bring swimwear if you want to swim. <br>
      There is a toilet, a fridge and a freezer for cold drinks and a lot of space for putting up <b>your tent</b>. <br>
      We will also take care that the party will not be close to the tents, so sleeping is possible for those who won't stay up long into the night. <br>
      <br>
      Timeline:<br>
      12:00 - Start of the party - Swimming - Welcome (Anthem Human)<br>
      13:00 - Crossbow Shooting (Arm ALL 1) - Snacks<br>
      14:30 - Flunky Ball<br>
      16:00 - BBQ / Fireplace is light up<br>
      18:00 - Time to feast!<br>
      21:00 - The fireplace moves to the other side of the pond, heavy drinking begins.<br>
      24:00 - Midnight feast <br>
      10:00 - Breakfast at the swimming pond <br>
      <br>
      If you can't make it to the start of the party, that is ok, you can join later as well.<br>
      Some people can make it, but want to spend this hot day in the city rather than swimming close to the forest, this is also ok.<br>
      You can come as you like, but please <b>let us know</b> an approximate time if you plan to <b>come later</b>. <br>
      Please keep in mind that Stefi will check if everyone is drinking enough alcohol.<br>
      It is possible that we even have a tent/camper van for you, please contact us.<br>
      The same applies to (free) rides to the place, let's organize shared rides!<br>
