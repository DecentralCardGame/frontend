      <h2>Patrick Wieth - Blockchain, Game Design and Development </h2>
      <p>While Patrick was doing his PhD he remembered that his parents told him to get some decent work instead of being a long time student.
      It must have been this moment, when he decided to create a game, since this must have been what his parents meant with decent work. <br>
      He liked it most when games offered enourmous possibilities and when these possibilities kept expanding over time. No wonder Magic the Gathering impressed him,
      but other games such as Path of Exile, Factorio and Warcraft III did as well. At one point he realized that all of these games keep growing over time because
      either the developers never stop developing (the former two, League of Legends) or the game allows the community to create new high quality game content (the
      latter two, Minecraft). It was impressive to Patrick, what the community was creating in some games, let alone creating a whole genre with Dota in Warcraft III.
      But there is a clear separation between competitive play and community content creation. There is no game that truly offers both. In Warcraft the custom maps are
      not part of the competitive play, in Factorio there is no real competitive play and in the other games, the game developers create the content and try to keep balance.
      How do they keep the balance? By looking at game outcomes and community feedback. Working with Blockchain technology for a couple of years, Patrick realized this
      might be an opportunity to bring competitive play and community content together. Of all possible genres of games, trading card games made the most sense to him,
      since cards are atomic pieces of such a game that can be easily created, are fun to collect and trade with other players and most importantly it makes a lot of sense
      to combine many different cards into a single deck. So this genre might benefit the most. The best part when playing a game was understanding how it works but still
      seeing new content and experiencing new situations. All of this is the reason why you are reading this text now.

      <h2> Marius Faust - Game Design and Development </h2>
      <p>After playing over 9000 different trading card games, Marius has decided that the world needs another one. He was also quite bored by Magic, because he already knew 13.000
      Magic cards by heart. Naturally there cannot be anything better than a game that will throw new cards at him for the rest of his life. Because of his great knowledge and vast
      experience in all other trading card games, it was very easy for him to show the pitfalls of Patrick's game design to him. Together both figured out the biggest problems of creating
      Crowd Control. One of that would be to prevent Players from creating cards, which can never be balanced. Imagine a card that does awesome things while being in the dust pile. You
      discard this card from your hand through another card, which is normally a negative effect, but in that case it might win you the game. Normally the card would be balanced by making
      it more expensive. We cannot do that, because its cost are never paid. This is considered an unbalanceable card. Marius has identified a couple of those cards and writes the grammar,
      which does not allow the creation of such cards. A grammar? Sounds like english class, well no, cards in collectible card games have abilities which follow rules. These abilities are
      written down according to a grammar. Marius defines this grammar and it is a hard job, because we want to have a card complexity similar to Magic the Gathering, but we cannot use
      the same grammar like Magic, because it creates unsolvable problems. In Magic these unsolvable problems are avoided by not printing conflicting cards, but here we cannot guarantee that,
      because you, the users, are allowed to create cards. And even in Magic the card creators should be aware, but still have failed sometimes, for example when the cards Humility and
      Opalescence came together. To solve this unsolvable Problem, the Magic judges decided to add more rules to the game. This is something we cannot do. And even if we could, it would not help,
      because Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem says that such problems, where you need to define a new rule to have a clear outcome, will never end. The only way out is to have a grammar, which do
      not have such undecidable things. If all of this just some crazy theoretical bla, then just keep in mind Marius is a nice guy, otherwise he is the one who defines this grammar.

      <h2> Thilo Billerbeck - Frontend </h2>
      <p>He likes games since his childhood. He also likes open source, but a bit later though. He likes to build websites and especially likes the design and technical realization of websites.
      He also likes new technology, especially in internet and communication. He likes modern architecture and usability. It is unbelievable how good that matches to this project here.
      Imagine someone who likes sex and money and wins a lottery, while being in front of a brothel. It's a bit like that but just with programming the frontend of Crowd Control. It might be
      a bit harder than the example with sex and money, because the pixels have a high need for uniqueness and never want to really align how the designers envisioned it. So whenever designers
      throw a new stylesheet or concept.pdf at Thilo, he just keeps cool and answers "I'll see what I can do". Once we thought we should challenge him a bit more and locked ourselves up in a
      holiday chalet, forced everyone into the sauna and hot tub in turns, but he still stayed cool. We also tried it with a Hackathon and forced us to code under pressure, didn't help either.
      But at the end we won two prizes and his face turned a bit red, so maybe that did the trick. So whenever you find a bug on the website, help us and throw it at Thilo. <br>
      In addition to that one needs to mention that it is a very hard job to make the creation of cards accessible, since the users are actually programming cards. But we must prevent them from
      knowing that fact. It should feel just like clicking some buttons and Thilo works on making these buttons friendly to you.

      <h2> Anna Zhu - Writer and Illustration </h2>
      <p>She did study Animation and Game but then worked on movie productions like “Game of Thrones” and “Fantastic Four”. Since we had a lot of compassion for her downfall we helped her by
      letting her work on a computer game. Since then she has greatly improved and no longer needs to work for such unknown side projects. We try to challenge her with our desires and wishes
      for the design, which are probably a bit overladen from from time to time. She keeps telling us, that our design needs to allow the users to make their own ideas fit in. When we keep saying
      we need huge dragons engraved on our card frame, then she keeps saying, that our ambition to copy Hearthstone is noble but might be not fitting for this project. When she is not trying to
      prevent us from totally screwing up the visual impression of the game and project, she is also leading in downplaying her own contribution to the project, which is accompanied by the fact that
      she has completely designed and drawn our first Deck. This includes a full fledged Story for its protagonist, Dr. Dolly and all the characters around it. In addition to that, she also playtests
      Crowd Control and gives us valuable insights how the game is perceived for someone who is not a total Magic nerd.

      <h2> Jannik Zettl - Game Designer </h2>
      <p>Jannik has also played over 9000 different collectible card games. He has also played over 9000 hours of Magic, so he might have an idea what this genre is about. He also hosts a playgroup, which
      freqeuently meets to play Magic, sometimes 3-5 times a week, but other times it is only every night. If he sold booster packs in his playgroup, he would be considered a game shop by the tax office.
      This relentless dedication to a very useful activity has not only made him a better human but also makes him our lead expert in power creep and demanding more game features. Without him the game
      would have been finished already, but it would be more like UNO or MS Hearts. When he is not playing card games, he also likes to stand naked in front of hot tubs and arguing why the passers-by are
      most likely not bothered. He might be the only person on earth who can beat Marius' 50 cards in 2 hours challenge, where you have to design 50 cards in 2 hours, which Marius is almost able to beat,
      it is just the card creator that needs to be more accessible.

      <h2> Stefi Rescheleit - Illustration </h2>
      <p>She likes to play Hearthstone and she likes to draw illustrations which are at least heartwarming and at best unforgettable to her audience. This makes her a perfect fit for Crowd Control and you
      might have guessd it already: She will create card illustrations. It will be a hard job to infuse life into Janniks cards, which were hammered together in 2 hours, but she will make it. She has
      already playtestet Crowd Control and writes the instructions for new players. The instructions will also be at least heartwarming and at best unforgettalbe to the audience. This is a hard job,
      since the rules keep changing all the time, the game designers explain it to her in the most technical way and want it to be written in the most technical way. Unfortunately users do not want that,
        so we are all excited to see how she will tackle this task.</p>

      <h2> Noah Faust - Game designer </h2>
      <p>He is actually the only one who does not want to work on the project. Unfortunately his older brother works here as well and he is stronger and trains Judo 2 times a week, so Noah cannot really choose
      to opt out. Noah and Marius have also agreed on a way of expressing this situation, which goes like this: "Well, I have thought about it and then I read what Marius/Noah wrote about it in the
      #game-mechanics channel and it is exactly what I thought". From a management point of view this can be a dangerous situation, but one needs to keep in mind, that we also need to keep Janniks urge for
      power creep in check it is great to have 2 "synced" minds. Noah is very good at doing these, because in trading card games he likes to create underpowered decks with strange mechanics. This gives
      him an edge which he plays out as a game designer for Crowd Control.
